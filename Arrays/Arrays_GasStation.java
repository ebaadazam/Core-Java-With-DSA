// GAS STATION

/*
Logic:
gas = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cost = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
difference = [1-3, 2-4, 3-5, 4-1, 5-2] = [-2, -2, -2, 3, 3]
At first the total will be initialized with 0 and we keep on adding the next number from difference to the
total.If the total has come around a number that is less than 0 then we are gonna set it to 0 again.
At last we will have the total fuel that can get us back to the starting position
